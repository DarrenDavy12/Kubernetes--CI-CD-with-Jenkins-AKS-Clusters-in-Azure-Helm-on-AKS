# Kubernetes-CI-CD-with-Jenkins-AKS-Clusters-in-Azure-Helm-on-AKS


This is my first attempt at Kubernetes on Azure.


The process: 

1. Setup Jenkins in AKS Cluster for CI/CD -> 
2. Setup AKS Kubernetes in Azure -> 
3. Access AKS Cluster from Local Machine -> 
4. Creation of Azure Container Registry (ACR) -> 
5. Install and configure Helm in Jenkins Server -> 
6. Add stable repo to Helm -> 
7. Pull helm chart from stable repo and create package -> 
8. Deploy Sample Application on AKS Kubernetes cluster with helm charts -> 
9. Creating Helm Charts 


I did hit many walls especially when installing and configuring Helm in Jenkins Server but Im still learning and a complete noob to kubernetes lol, I just wanted to get my hands dirty for fun!
